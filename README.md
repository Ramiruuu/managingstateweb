## 🌐 State Management in Web Applications
An interactive mini-lab by **Remar Gonzaga Oclarit**, exploring the core principles of state management in web development using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This project transforms abstract concepts into hands-on, visual micro-projects, making state management approachable and fun.

### 📌 What Is State Management?
In web development, **state** is the dynamic data that defines how an app looks and behaves at any moment. Managing state effectively is key to building responsive and user-friendly interfaces. This project demonstrates how to handle state without relying on frameworks, using pure JavaScript.

### 🎮 Hands-On Modules

#### 🔹 Module 1: Say My Name
A real-time input/output experiment where users type their name and receive a personalized greeting. It’s your app saying: *"Hey, I’m listening!"*

#### 🔹 Module 2: Count of the Clicks
A lightweight counter that increases and decreases (but never drops below zero). A true test of local state preservation.

#### 🔹 Module 3: Now You See Me
Click a button, and content appears or disappears. Pure toggle magic powered by visibility state.

#### 🔹 Module 4: Who’s Logged In?
Simulates a global login using a shared `appState`. Once "logged in," the entire interface responds dynamically—headers, sidebars, and more update as if the app just woke up to a new user.

### 🧠 Why This Project Exists
Frameworks like React and Vue simplify state management, but understanding the fundamentals is crucial. This project is a back-to-basics approach, showcasing the power of **vanilla JavaScript** in managing state.
