🌐 State Management in Web Applications
A simple, interactive web project by Ramiruu also known as Remar Gonzaga Oclarit, exploring how state is managed in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project includes 4 hands-on activities demonstrating different types of state management such as local state, visibility toggling, and simulated global state sharing.

📌 About the Project
This project focuses on the concept of state management in web applications. State refers to the data or values that control how a web app looks and behaves at a given time. Managing state effectively is crucial in building interactive and user-friendly interfaces.

🧩 Activities

🔹 Activity 1: Local State Management with Input and Display
An input field where users type their name, and a dynamic greeting like “Hello, Remar!” appears instantly.

🔹 Activity 2: Counter App (Local State)
A basic counter with “+” and “−” buttons that updates the number on-screen, ensuring it doesn’t go below zero.

🔹 Activity 3: Toggling a Section (Visibility State)
A button to show or hide a specific section of content, demonstrating simple visibility toggling through state.

🔹 Activity 4: Global State Sharing (User Login Simulation)
Simulates a login system using a shared appState object. Once “logged in,” the user’s name appears in the header and sidebar—just like a real-world web app.

🌐 StateCraft: Mastering State in the Front-End Realm
An interactive mini-lab by Remar Gonzaga Oclarit — diving deep into the unseen forces that drive web interactivity: state management using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Built with simplicity and curiosity in mind, this 4-part experience turns abstract state concepts into fun, visual, and functional micro-projects.

📌 What Is This?
In modern web development, state is the pulse of your application — it decides what users see, what they interact with, and how the app responds. Without proper state management, everything falls apart.
This project was crafted to demystify state — by showing how you can manipulate it from scratch without the need for heavy frameworks.

🎮 Hands-On Modules

🔹 Module 1: Say My Name
A real-time input/output experiment where users type their name and receive a personalized greeting. It’s your app saying: "Hey, I’m listening!"

🔹 Module 2: Count of the Clicks
A lightweight counter that increases and decreases (but never drops below zero). A true test of local state preservation.

🔹 Module 3: Now You See Me
Click a button, and content appears or disappears. Pure toggle magic powered by visibility state.

🔹 Module 4: Who’s Logged In?
Simulates a global login using a shared appState. Once "logged in," the entire interface responds. Headers, sidebars, and more update as if the app just woke up to a new user.

🛠 Under the Hood

HTML5 — for structure

CSS3 — for flavor

JavaScript (ES6) — the engine behind it all

Font Awesome — for that visual spice

🧠 Why This Project Exists
Because frameworks like React and Vue do a lot of the heavy lifting for us — but before we rely on magic, we need to understand the spell. This is vanilla JavaScript at its most educational — simple, readable, and powerful.
